# Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks for testing features on the Jupyterlab platform. It contains the following subfolders:

- **manual**: contains notebooks which should be run manually, and will not be included in smoke tests. These notebooks can be more time and memory consuming.  
- **smoke-tests**: contains relatively fast running notebooks for testing and asserting various features. They are divided into:
    - **python**: contains notebooks written in Python
    - **R**: contains notebooks written in R
